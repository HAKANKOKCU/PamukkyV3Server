# Pamukky V3 Server
https://pamukky.netlify.app/v3
# Setup
* You need to download the JS
* Make a working directory for it and create another folder named as `"uploads"`
* Run the server. 
The default port is `8080`, but at the line `const port = 8080;`, you can replace `8080` to the port you want
# NOTE
Please don't force quit (ctrl + c), if you are using termux, you can click "exit" at notification. or it will not save any data (INCLUDING crashes). So restart the server often
