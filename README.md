# Pamukky V3 Server
https://pamukky.netlify.app/v3
# Setup
* You need to download the JS
* Make a working directory for it
* Run the server. 
The default port is `8080`, but at the line `const port = 8080;`, you can replace `8080` to the port you want
# Command Line Parameters
## --CLEANUP_UNUSEDFILES
This command line parameter allows you to **SCAN** unused files, like: Old pfp's, deleted message files and etc.
## --WIPEUNUSED
This commad wipes scanned files, **does nothing without `--CLEANUP_UNUSEDFILES`**
# NOTE
Please don't force quit (ctrl + c), if you are using termux (I dont really recommend if you have a computer), you can click "exit" at notification. or it will not save any data (INCLUDING crashes). So restart the server often

LocalTunnel performance is too bad for this server, might logout you randomly at clients (read twice if you use localtunnel)
